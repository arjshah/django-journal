# Django Journal App
A django web application that allows a user to create, update, and view topics and entries while they learn.

Users can:
- Register
- Login
- Create new topic
- Create entries per topic
- View and update topic and entries
- Logout
- Admin users can manage data using Django Admin

I'm using:
- Django version 4.2.4
- Bootstrap4

I used GitHub Copilot in building this application. The auto-complete feature was nice, but it did make a few incorrect reference calls and syntax errors.

To run:
- Clone repository
- Configur a virtualenv
- Make sure you have python 3.9+, django 4.2+, and bootstrap4 installed
- Run on localhost using python manage.py runserver 8000
