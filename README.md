# Django Journal App
This is a simple Django web application that allows a user to view topics of interest and entries per topic. Currently, the only way to create topics and entries is via the Django Admin interface. I'll be adding new functionality in the future to:

- Allow non-admin users to create topics and entries
- Allow users to create accounts and login
- Allow users to share topics with other users

I used GitHub Copilot while building this application. The auto-complete feature was nice, but it made a few mistakes (i.e suggesting incorrect function references) that I had to correct.
